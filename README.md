# hello-world.
Initial trial
I am a young aspiring programmer and wantrepreneur in the field of decomposable bioplastics. I raised awareness for climate change starting in 2008. I was a founding member of Students for a Just and Stable Future. I worked for 350.org and the Energy Justice Network. Now I host a radio program at Eastern Connecticut State University and am applying for to work for SolarCity and nanoFlowcell Holdings Ltd. My mission in life is to reverse anthropogenic climate change. In my spare time I make hip hop music, trade futures (in paper trade account) and choose investments for my family. In 2009 I had the idea to invest in TSLA, went to my family's investment manager, proposed the idea to him and he told me I would lose all my money. Had I been more headstrong at the time I would have pulled my funds from him and done the investment on my own. Since then, TSLA has gone from $12.50 to over $300 a share. I would be a multi millionare several times over had I believed in my own analysis. Now I do my own analysis and am being trained as a forex trader with support from a firm.
